# Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `clean_text_rhoni` for local development.

### Install the package for development

This package is developed by using `poetry` as package manager.
To install the package for development you will have to:

1. Download a copy of `clean_text_rhoni` locally.
2. Install `poetry` in your computer. Please check the last instalation instructions on their [website](https://python-poetry.org/).
3. Create a python environment and activate it.
4. Install `clean_text_rhoni` on editable-mode by using `poetry` in your environment:

    ```console
    $ poetry install
    ```

### Create a new git branch

1. Use `git` (or similar) to create a branch for local development and make your changes:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

### Commiting changes

To commit your changes, please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) conventions.


### Contributions on code

1. Code is located in `src/clean_text_rhoni` folder.
You can add features, fix or refactor existing code.

2. When you're done making changes, check that your changes conform to any code formatting requirements and pass any tests.

If you add new features: 

* add the corresponding test in `test/` folder.
* modify or add documentation if necessary


### Testing the package

This package uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) for testing.
To run the packageâ€™s tests, you must be in the root of the package and run:

```
pytest tests/
```

**Testing the package on different python versions**

This package was developed on Ubuntu 22.04 and tested on python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.
If you add new features, you have to test that the package is still working under the different versions.
The easiest way to do this, is by using [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The necessary `Dockerfiles` and the `docker-compose.yml` file are included in the package.
To run it, you'll have to:

1. Install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in your computer.
2. Install [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in your computer.
3. Build the docker images defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
Open a terminal and go to the root of the package. Then run:

```bash
docker compose build
```
4. Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up
```

As result you will have to see that code coverage is calculated for each python version, and that every process is exited with code 0. This is, the processes were completed successfully without encountering any errors.

You will see something similar to:

```bash
clean_text_rhoni-py38-1 exited with code 0
```
for each python version that is being tested.

### Contributions on documentation

**Documenting functions and classes**

We use [`numpydoc style`](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) to add docstrings. Please follow its conventions.

**Documenting README.md**

You can add examples or description of new features to the readme file if necessary.
